Let us consider some relevant simple examples. 

\subsection{Piecewise linear function}

Consider the simple case where $f(x; \theta(t), t) = \theta(t)$.
If $\theta(t) = \theta_0$ constant, then the solution $x(t)$ are simply linear functions. 
If our notion of smoothness is dictated by linear functions, that is, linear functions are consider smooth, we can then aim to find piecewise constant functions $\theta(t)$.
